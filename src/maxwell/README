This directory contains code for operating the Maxwell operator on
a vector field:

	MaxwellOp(V) = curl(1/eps * curl(V))

We store V in a Fourier basis, so that the curl operation is diagonal.
To multiply by epsilon-inverse, we use a pair of FFTs to transform to
and from position space.

Also included are initialization routines for the auxiliary data and
storage required by MaxwellOp, as well as subsidiary routines to
compute things like the curl and the energy density.
